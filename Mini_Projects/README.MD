Learning Exercises Repository:
This directory contains a collection of simple, often single-page programs I created while learning to code.

These scripts are primarily focused on practicing core concepts and problem-solving rather than implementing production-ready structures. While most of them would require a more robust architecture for real-world use, 
the goal here was to keep things minimal and concentrate on learning fundamentals.
Efficiency and scalability were intentionally deprioritized to avoid unnecessary complexity during the learning process.
