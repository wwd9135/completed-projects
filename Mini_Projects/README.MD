# Lab-Environment: Scripting & Logic Exercises

This repository serves as a personal laboratory for practicing core programming concepts and system logic. These scripts are **Learning Exercises** and are not intended for production environments.

## 🧪 Project Purpose
The focus here is on "Minimum Viable Logic." I created these to strengthen my understanding of specific fundamentals without the overhead of enterprise frameworks.

**Key areas of practice include:**
* **Logic Flow:** Testing conditional statements and looping structures.
* **Problem Solving:** Breaking down manual tasks into automated steps.
* **Syntax Familiarity:** Getting "hands-on" with language-specific quirks.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: Non-Production Code
* **Status:** Experimental / In-Progress.
* **Architecture:** Intentionally minimal. Scalability and complex error handling have been deprioritized to focus on the core algorithm.
* **Security:** These scripts have not been hardened for security best practices and should only be run in isolated test environments.

## 📂 Featured Exercises
* **Task Automation:** Simple scripts to handle file I/O and directory management.
* **Data Parsing:** Basic string manipulation and regex testing.
* **System Queries:** Pulling basic WMI/CIM information from local endpoints.

## 📈 Learning Roadmap
The goal of this repository is to track my transition from basic procedural scripting to more advanced, modular, and "security-first" development. Once a concept is mastered here, it is usually refactored and moved into a dedicated, production-ready repository.
