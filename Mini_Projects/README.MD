# Learning Exercises Repository

This directory contains a collection of simple, often single‑page programs created during my early coding practice.

These scripts focus on strengthening core concepts and problem‑solving skills rather than implementing production‑ready architectures. While many of them would require more robust structure for real‑world use, the intention here is to keep things minimal and concentrate on learning the fundamentals.

Efficiency and scalability were intentionally deprioritized to avoid unnecessary complexity during the learning process.
