# This is designed as a basic input filtering tool, it is in the form of a password accepter mainly because I am familiar with this type of product to a more advance level in other languages.
# Therefor this isn't a production ready product it merely illustrates input filtering best practice in Python, I had no interest in adding functionaility to create working user accounts
# Nor upload the passwords to a real database. I will be doing this at a later date.
