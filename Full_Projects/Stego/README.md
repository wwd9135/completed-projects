Stego is a steganography project I built early in my Python learning journey. It’s a desktop GUI application that allows users to upload an image and embed a hidden message inside it.
The process involves encrypting the message, storing it within the image, and later decrypting it. While I successfully implemented the core steganography functionality and the GUI, I didn’t complete the full feature set. 
Handling secure decryption across sessions and implementing a reliable user account system proved challenging at the time.
This version works well for basic steganography but isn’t intended for full-scale deployment. Future iterations will focus on improving encryption, session management, and overall security.
