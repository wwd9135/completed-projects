This folder contains the first encryption algorithm I developed as part of my initial Python learning journey. It was inspired by concepts I understood while studying AES-256.


My goal was to create an encryptor and a corresponding decryptor. While I successfully implemented encryption, I encountered challenges during the decryption process for certain stages.


Now that I have more experience, I recognize areas where the code quality could be significantly improved. I plan to revisit this project and redesign the entire concept with better practices and efficiency in mind.
