# Project-Portfolio: Systems & Security Engineering

This repository serves as a central hub for my technical work, ranging from fundamental logic exercises to production-ready enterprise frameworks. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
- ([Mini_projects](./Mini_projects)) Mini_projects: This is mainly projects from my learning journey, single file programs, most not being production level purely training exercies.

### [PowerShell-Projects](./PowerShell_Projects)
**Focus:** Enterprise Administration & Security Automation
Technical showcases developed during my professional placement. These scripts focus on real-world problems such as Intune fleet management, Active Directory auditing, and automated endpoint diagnostics.

### [Mini-Projects](./Mini_projects)
**Focus:** Scripting Fundamentals & Logic Practice
A collection of "Lab" exercises created during my early learning journey. These are primarily single-file programs designed to strengthen core problem-solving skills and syntax familiarity. 
*Note: These are experimental/training exercises and are not intended for production environments.*

### [Full-Projects](./Full_projects)
**Focus:** Advanced Architecture & Production Tools
Comprehensive, modular projects featuring robust directory structures, error handling, and technical documentation. These tools are engineered to be scalable and ready for deployment in production-standard environments.

## Methodology
My development process follows a three-stage evolution:
1.  **Exploration:** Practicing new concepts in the `Mini-Projects` sandbox.
2.  **Implementation:** Solving specific business needs in `PowerShell-Projects`.
3.  **Refactoring:** Transitioning successful scripts into fully-documented, modular solutions in `Full-Projects`.
